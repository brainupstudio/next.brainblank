# ðŸ§  BrainBlank project â€“ Strapi + Next.js

The power of Strapi as a backend and the versatility of Next.js for the frontend are the basis of this project.
The backend project can be found [here](https://github.com/brainupstudio/strapi.brainblank)

## Project settings
Create .env file on root folder and set these variables.

```
# PUBLIC
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_DOMAIN='http://localhost:1337'
NEXT_PUBLIC_NAVIGATION_ID=1 (Your main Navigation ID)

# PRIVATE
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API='$NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_DOMAIN/api'
PRODUCTION_IMAGES_HOSTNAME='https:...' (Optional if images are hosted in different place than Strapi)
```

## Getting Started with Next.js
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
